            <h2>Introduction <sup>Chapter 1</sup></h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
              <a href="#" target="_blank">their own section</a>. Continue
              reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native
              Components, React, and more!

            <h2>Core components <sup>Chapter 2</sup></h2>
            <p>
              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components:
              <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code</em>. You can learn more
              about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
              components work in React Native.

            <h2>React fundamentals <sup>Chapter 3</sup></h2>
            <p>
              React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source
              library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the
              most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
              section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to
                React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable
                creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
                that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.
                <p>
                  The React docs have
                  <a href="#" target="_blank">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a>
                  you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
                  you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                  <code>name</code> for the cat, name, and embedding it with
                  curly braces inside
                  <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as
                arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
                like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
                handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                interaction. State gives your components memory!
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>handling text input <sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an <span>onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to
              be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
              that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
